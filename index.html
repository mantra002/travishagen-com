    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>I was born in Reno, Nevada and grew up there. Ever since I was a child, I have been profoundly curious about the world and have had a thirst for knowledge that continues to this day. After graduating with my mechanical engineering degree, I moved to Corvallis, Oregon to take an engineering position with Hewlett-Packard Company (now HP Inc).</p>
    <p> There I learned how to design, test, and improve inkjet printers. Initially this seemed easy, inkjet has been around for 25 years after all, however as I learned more, I realized how complicated they truly are. A standard inkjet printer is a complex integration of servos, silicon, and embedded systems capable of firing 30,000 ink drops per second (themselves measured in picolitres)  capable of hitting a target measured in microns. After five years there my (at the time) girlfriend graduated from Oregon State University and accepted a job in Vancouver, Washington.</p>
    <p> We both moved up together, I was able to transfer to another HP site located there. Now I worked in HP’s OEM business selling print technology to other product development companies. In this roll I developed technical platforms for OEMs, directly supported OEMs integrating our products, and provided overall technical leadership for new products.</p>
    <p> I’m now married to my beautiful wife and together we live with our small, scruffy dog pepper and a black cat named Kona.</p>
